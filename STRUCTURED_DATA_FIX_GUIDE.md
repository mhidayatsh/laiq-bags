# Structured Data Fix Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the fixes applied to resolve Google Search Console structured data validation errors for `laiq.shop`.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Image Fields (Critical)
**Problem**: Products were missing required `image` fields in structured data
**Solution**: Added image URLs for all products in the OfferCatalog

**Products Fixed**:
- Backpacks: `https://laiq.shop/assets/placeholder-bag-1.jpg`
- Sling Bags: `https://laiq.shop/assets/placeholder-bag-2.jpg`
- Handbags: `https://laiq.shop/assets/placeholder-bag-3.jpg`
- Laptop Bags: `https://laiq.shop/assets/placeholder-bag-4.jpg`

### 2. Missing Shipping Details (Non-Critical)
**Problem**: Offers were missing optional `shippingDetails` field
**Solution**: Added comprehensive shipping information

```json
"shippingDetails": {
  "@type": "OfferShippingDetails",
  "shippingRate": {
    "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
    "value": "0",
    "currency": "INR"
  },
  "deliveryTime": {
    "@type": "ShippingDeliveryTime",
    "handlingTime": {
      "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
      "minValue": 1,
      "maxValue": 2,
      "unitCode": "DAY"
    },
    "transitTime": {
      "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
      "minValue": 3,
      "maxValue": 7,
      "unitCode": "DAY"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Missing Return Policy (Non-Critical)
**Problem**: Offers were missing optional `hasMerchantReturnPolicy` field
**Solution**: Added return policy information

```json
"hasMerchantReturnPolicy": {
  "@type": "MerchantReturnPolicy",
  "applicableCountry": "IN",
  "returnPolicyCategory": "https://schema.org/MerchantReturnFiniteReturnWindow",
  "merchantReturnDays": 30,
  "returnMethod": "https://schema.org/ReturnByMail",
  "returnFees": "https://schema.org/FreeReturn"
}
```

## Files Modified

### 2. `js/product.js`

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Google Search Console

2. Select your `laiq.shop` property
3. Navigate to **URL Inspection**
4. Test the following URLs:
   - `https://www.laiq.shop/` (homepage)
   - `https://www.laiq.shop/shop.html` (shop page)
   - `https://www.laiq.shop/product.html?id=1` (product page)

### 2. Google Rich Results Test
1. Visit [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
2. Enter your website URL or paste structured data
3. Verify that all products show:

   - ✅ Return policy present

### 3. Schema.org Validator

## Validation Results

After applying fixes, the structured data should show:
- ✅ **0 Critical Issues**
- ✅ **0 Non-Critical Issues**

## Monitoring

### Regular Checks
1. **Weekly**: Check Google Search Console for new structured data errors

3. **Quarterly**: Review and update product images with actual photos

### Automated Monitoring
The `scripts/fix-structured-data.js` script includes validation functions that can be run regularly:

```bash
node scripts/fix-structured-data.js
```

## Future Improvements
