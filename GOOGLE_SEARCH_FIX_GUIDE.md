# Google Search Duplicate URL Fix Guide

## üö® Issue Summary
When searching for "laiq backpack" on Google, you're seeing two different URLs:
1. `https://laiq.shop` (non-www version)
2. `https://www.laiq.shop > shop` (www version)

This is a **duplicate content issue** that splits your SEO performance.

## ‚úÖ Technical Status
Your server is **correctly configured** with 301 redirects from `laiq.shop` to `www.laiq.shop`. The issue is that Google has already indexed both versions.

## üéØ Solution Steps

1. **Add Both Domains to Search Console:**
   - Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
   - Add `laiq.shop` (Domain property)
   - Add `https://www.laiq.shop/` (URL prefix property)

2. **Set Preferred Domain:**
   - In the `https://www.laiq.shop/` property
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Domain settings
   - Set preferred domain to `www.laiq.shop`

3. **Submit Updated Sitemap:**
   - Submit `https://www.laiq.shop/sitemap.xml` to both properties

### Step 2: Request URL Removal (Optional)

1. **In Search Console:**
   - Go to Removals ‚Üí Temporary removals
   - Request removal of `laiq.shop` URLs
   - This helps Google understand the redirect faster

### Step 3: Monitor and Wait

**Timeline:**
