## üîç **Video Indexing Explanation:**

The video isn't indexed because it's "supplementary content" rather than a dedicated video page. This is normal for:
- Hero videos on landing pages
- Background videos
- Promotional content

**However**, with the added VideoObject schema markup, Google may:
- Index the video for video search
- Show video information in rich snippets
- Improve overall page understanding

## üéâ **Conclusion:**

The Google Search Console status shows your site is being crawled correctly. The main issues were domain inconsistencies and missing video schema markup, both of which have been fixed. Your site should now have:

1. **Consistent domain usage** across all pages
