# Tracking System Fix Report

## Issue Identified
The product tracking system was not working due to a missing API function. The error message showed:
```
Error updating tracking: TypeError: api.updateOrderTracking is not a function
```

## Root Cause
The `updateOrderTracking` function was being called in both `shipping-management.js` and `enhanced-order-management.js` but was not defined in the `api.js` file.

## Files Affected
1. **js/api.js** - Added missing `updateOrderTracking` function
2. **js/shipping-management.js** - Uses the function (line 622)
3. **js/enhanced-order-management.js** - Uses the function (line 684)

## Fix Applied

### Added to js/api.js:
```javascript
async updateOrderTracking(orderId, trackingData) {
    return await this.request(`/orders/admin/${orderId}/tracking`, {
        method: 'PUT',
        body: JSON.stringify(trackingData)
    });
}
```

## Backend Support
The backend route already exists and is properly configured:
- **Route**: `PUT /api/orders/admin/:id/tracking`
- **File**: `routes/orders.js` (lines 676-720)
- **Authentication**: Requires admin role
- **Functionality**: Updates tracking information and automatically changes status to 'shipped' if tracking number is provided

## Testing
1. ✅ API function added successfully
2. ✅ Function signature matches expected usage
3. ✅ Backend route exists and is properly configured
4. ✅ Authentication and authorization are in place

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Tracking information can be updated through the shipping management interface
- Tracking modal should work without errors
- Order status will automatically update to 'shipped' when tracking number is added
- Both shipping management and enhanced order management pages will work

## Verification Steps
1. Access shipping management page
2. Open tracking update modal for any order
3. Fill in tracking details (number, courier, delivery date)
4. Submit the form
5. Should see success message and no console errors

## Files Modified
- `js/api.js` - Added missing function
- `TRACKING_SYSTEM_FIX_REPORT.md` - This documentation

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Tracking system should now work properly
